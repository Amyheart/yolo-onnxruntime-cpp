# yolo-onnxruntime-cpp
This example demonstrates how to perform inference using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 in C++ with ONNX Runtime and OpenCV's API.

It's based on ultralytics YOLOv8 example: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/examples/YOLOv8-ONNXRuntime-CPP.

This project supports inference of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with onnx model(static or dynamic model).
# Runtime Environment
Onnxruntime = onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu-1.16.0 or onnxruntime-win-x64-1.16.0

Opencv = opencv-4.8.0
